# Cataract Detection and Classification

This project focuses on detecting cataracts in eye images using the VGG19 architecture. The trained model is integrated into a Flask web application where users can upload images of their eyes. The uploaded images are then processed by the model to determine whether cataracts are present and, if so, classify the type of cataract detected.

## Features

- Utilizes VGG19 architecture for cataract detection.
- Web application allows users to upload eye images for analysis.
- Classifies images into categories: cataract present or not, and type of cataract if detected.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
